**🐍 Python – Basics to Advanced**

This repository contains Python programs from beginner to advanced level, aimed at helping learners understand core programming concepts through hands-on practice.Each program is simple, well-structured, and focuses on one concept at a time, making revision easy and effective.

<u>**1.Basic Python Programs**</u>

**1️⃣ Add Two Numbers (Add_Two_Number.py)**
   
➤ Concepts Used:
     
    ● Variables
      
    ● Integer data type
      
    ● Input and output
  
➤ Description:
   
   This program takes two integer values from the user using input(), converts them into integers using int(), and calculates their sum. The result is displayed using the print() function.

**2️⃣ Even or Odd (Even_Odd.py)**

➤ Concepts Used:
     
    ● Modulus operator (%)
   
    ● Conditional statements (if-else)
   
➤ Description:
   
   The program checks whether a given number is even or odd by dividing it by 2.
   If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.

**3️⃣ Factorial of a Number (Factorial.py)**

➤ Concepts Used:

    ● Loops (for)
   
    ● Multiplication
   
    ● Variables

➤ Description:

   This program calculates the factorial of a given number.
   The factorial is computed by multiplying all positive integers from 1 to the given number.

➤ Example:

   Factorial of 5 = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

**4️⃣ Largest of Three Numbers (Largest_of_Three_Numbers.py)**

➤ Concepts Used:

    ● User input
   
    ● Built-in function max()

➤ Description:

   The program takes three numbers from the user and determines the largest number using Python’s built-in max() function.

**5️⃣ Prime Number Check (Prime.py)**

➤ Concepts Used:

    ● Loops
   
    ● Conditional statements
   
    ● break and else with loops

➤ Description:

   This program checks whether a number is prime.
   A number is prime if it is greater than 1 and divisible only by 1 and itself.
   The program tests divisibility from 2 to n-1.
   If any divisor is found, the number is not prime.

**6️⃣ Reverse a Number (Reverse.py)**

➤ Concepts Used:

    ● While loop
   
    ● Modulus (%)
   
    ● Integer division (//)

➤ Description:

   The program reverses a given number by extracting digits one by one and constructing the reversed number.

➤ Example:
   
   Input: 1234
   
   Output: 4321

**7️⃣ Print Numbers from 1 to 100 (Print1-100.py)**

➤ Concepts Used:

    ● For loop
   
    ● range() function

➤ Description:
  
   This program prints numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop.

**2.Intermediate Python Programs**

1️⃣ Fibonacci Series (Fibonacci_Series.py)

➤ Concepts Used:

    ● Loops (for)

    ● Variable assignment

    ● Sequence generation

➤ Description:

This program generates a Fibonacci series up to a given number of terms.
It starts with two initial values (0 and 1), and each next number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

2️⃣ Palindrome String (Palindrome_String.py)

➤ Concepts Used:

    ● Strings

    ● String slicing

    ● Conditional statements

➤ Description:

The program checks whether a given string is a palindrome by reversing the string using slicing ([::-1]) and comparing it with the original string.

3️⃣ Armstrong Number (Armstrong_Number.py)

➤ Concepts Used:

    ● While loop

    ● Arithmetic operators

    ● Integer manipulation

➤ Description:

This program checks whether a number is an Armstrong number.
Each digit of the number is raised to the power of the number of digits and summed.
If the sum equals the original number, it is an Armstrong number.

4️⃣ Count Vowels in a String (Count_Vowels.py)

➤ Concepts Used:

    ● Strings

    ● Loops

    ● Conditional checking

➤ Description:

The program iterates through each character of a string and counts how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are present.

5️⃣ Remove Duplicates from a List (Remove_Duplicates.py)

➤ Concepts Used:

    ● Lists

    ● Sets

    ● Type conversion

➤ Description:

This program removes duplicate elements from a list by converting the list into a set and then back into a list.

6️⃣ Linear Search (Linear_Search.py)

➤ Concepts Used:

    ● Lists

    ● Loops

    ● Conditional statements

➤ Description:

The program searches for a given element in a list by checking each element one by one.
If the element is found, it prints a success message.


7️⃣ Bubble Sort (Bubble_Sort.py)

➤ Concepts Used:

    ● Nested loops

    ● List manipulation

    ● Swapping elements

➤ Description:

This program sorts a list of numbers using the Bubble Sort algorithm by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
