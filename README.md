🐍 Python – Basics to Advanced
This repository contains Python programs from beginner to advanced level, aimed at helping learners understand core programming concepts through hands-on practice.Each program is simple, well-structured, and focuses on one concept at a time, making revision easy and effective.

1.Basic Python Programs

1️⃣ Add Two Numbers (Add_Two_Number.py)
   
➤ Concepts Used:
     
  ● Variables
      
  ● Integer data type
      
  ● Input and output
  
➤ Description:
   
   This program takes two integer values from the user using input(), converts them into integers using int(), and calculates their sum. The result is displayed using the print() function.

2️⃣ Even or Odd (Even_Odd.py)

➤ Concepts Used:

   ● Modulus operator (%)
   
   ● Conditional statements (if-else)
   
➤ Description:
   
   The program checks whether a given number is even or odd by dividing it by 2.
   If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.

3️⃣ Factorial of a Number (Factorial.py)

➤ Concepts Used:

   ● Loops (for)
   
   ● Multiplication
   
   ● Variables

➤ Description:

   This program calculates the factorial of a given number.
   The factorial is computed by multiplying all positive integers from 1 to the given number.

➤ Example:

   Factorial of 5 = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

4️⃣ Largest of Three Numbers (Largest_of_Three_Numbers.py)

➤ Concepts Used:

   ● User input
   
   ● Built-in function max()

➤ Description:

   The program takes three numbers from the user and determines the largest number using Python’s built-in max() function.

5️⃣ Prime Number Check (Prime.py)

➤ Concepts Used:

   ● Loops
   
   ● Conditional statements
   
   ● break and else with loops

➤ Description:

   This program checks whether a number is prime.
   A number is prime if it is greater than 1 and divisible only by 1 and itself.
   The program tests divisibility from 2 to n-1.
   If any divisor is found, the number is not prime.

6️⃣ Reverse a Number (Reverse.py)

➤ Concepts Used:

   ● While loop
   
   ● Modulus (%)
   
   ● Integer division (//)

➤ Description:

   The program reverses a given number by extracting digits one by one and constructing the reversed number.

➤ Example:

   ● Input: 1234
   
   ● Output: 4321

7️⃣ Print Numbers from 1 to 100 (Print1-100.py)

➤ Concepts Used:

   ● or loop
   
   ● range() function

➤ Description:
  
   ● This program prints numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop.
