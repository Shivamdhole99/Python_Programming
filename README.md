🐍 Python – Basics to Advanced

This repository contains Python programs from beginner to advanced level, aimed at helping learners understand core programming concepts through hands-on practice.
Each program is simple, well-structured, and focuses on one concept at a time, making revision easy and effective.

1.Basic Python Programs
1️⃣ Add Two Numbers (Add_Two_Number.py)
   > Concepts Used:
     Variables
     Integer data type
     Input and output
   > Description:
     This program takes two integer values from the user using input(), converts them into integers using int(), and calculates their sum. The result is displayed using the print() function.
     
2️⃣ Even or Odd (Even_Odd.py)
    > Concepts Used:
      Modulus operator (%)
      Conditional statements (if-else)
    > Description:
      The program checks whether a given number is even or odd by dividing it by 2.
      If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.

3️⃣ Factorial of a Number (Factorial.py)
    > Concepts Used:
      Loops (for)
      Multiplication
      Variables
    > Description:
      This program calculates the factorial of a given number.
      The factorial is computed by multiplying all positive integers from 1 to the given number.
    > Example:
      Factorial of 5 = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

4️⃣ Largest of Three Numbers (Largest_of_Three_Numbers.py)
    > Concepts Used:
      User input
      Built-in function max()
    > Description:
      The program takes three numbers from the user and determines the largest number using Python’s built-in max() function.

5️⃣ Prime Number Check (Prime.py)
   > Concepts Used:
     Loops
     Conditional statements
     break and else with loops
   > Description:
     This program checks whether a number is prime.
     A number is prime if it is greater than 1 and divisible only by 1 and itself.
     The program tests divisibility from 2 to n-1.
     If any divisor is found, the number is not prime.

6️⃣ Reverse a Number (Reverse.py)
   > Concepts Used:
     While loop
     Modulus (%)
     Integer division (//)
   > Description:
     The program reverses a given number by extracting digits one by one and constructing the reversed number.
   > Example:
     Input: 1234
     Output: 4321

7️⃣ Print Numbers from 1 to 100 (Print1-100.py)
   > Concepts Used:
     for loop
     range() function
   > Description:
     This program prints numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop.
